  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

  <p>This is a paragraph. I am learning CSS and the Box Model. CSS helps me change colors, spacing, and the layout of my page.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>The Box Model</h2>
    <p>The box model has content, padding, border, and margin. This is how it works.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is my first time doing it and it is really fun and challenging for a beginner.</p>
